|---------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| `DNS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` | ✅ **CONSOLIDATED** | `infra/dns-cloudflare.md` | DNS records, tunnel config, routing strategy |
| `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_SETUP.md` | ✅ **CONSOLIDATED** | `infra/dns-cloudflare.md` | Step-by-step setup, testing procedures |
| `CLOUDFLARE_SECURITY_SETUP.md` | ✅ **CONSOLIDATED** | `infra/security.md` | Security configuration, authentication layers |
| `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | ✅ **CONSOLIDATED** | `infra/deployment.md` | Deployment procedures, service management |
| `docs/context/homelab/infra/networks.md` | ✅ **ENHANCED** | `infra/networks.md` | Already existed, enhanced with additional context |

#### **Application Documentation**
| Original File | Status | Consolidated Into | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Various app docs | ✅ **CONSOLIDATED** | `applications.md` | All application services and management |

## 🗑️ **Files Safe to Archive/Delete**

### **Root Level Files (Safe to Archive)**
- ✅ `DNS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` → Consolidated into `infra/dns-cloudflare.md`
- ✅ `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_SETUP.md` → Consolidated into `infra/dns-cloudflare.md`
- ✅ `CLOUDFLARE_SECURITY_SETUP.md` → Consolidated into `infra/security.md`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Consolidated into `infra/deployment.md`

### **Documentation Files (Safe to Archive)**
- ✅ Any duplicate documentation in `docs/` that was consolidated
- ✅ Old setup guides that are now covered in the new structure

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **1. Archive Original Files**
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/archive/old-docs

# Move original files to archive
mv /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/DNS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/archive/old-docs/
mv /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/CLOUDFLARE_DNS_SETUP.md /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/archive/old-docs/
mv /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/CLOUDFLARE_SECURITY_SETUP.md /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/archive/old-docs/
mv /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md /home/chris/github/hephaestus-homelab/archive/old-docs/
```

### **2. Verify Consolidation**
- [ ] Review new consolidated files for completeness
- [ ] Check that all important information was preserved
- [ ] Verify cross-references between documents
- [ ] Test context pack integration

### **3. Update References**
- [ ] Update any scripts or automation that referenced old files
- [ ] Update README files that linked to old documentation
- [ ] Update any external references

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

### **Content Verification**
- [ ] All DNS records and tunnel configuration preserved
- [ ] All security policies and authentication layers documented
- [ ] All deployment procedures and commands included
- [ ] All service definitions and port mappings documented
- [ ] All troubleshooting procedures preserved
- [ ] All testing procedures included

### **Structure Verification**
- [ ] YAML front matter added to all documents
- [ ] Cross-references between documents working

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Before Archiving**
1. **Review each consolidated file** to ensure all important information was preserved
2. **Check for any unique content** in original files that might not have been consolidated
3. **Verify all commands and configurations** are accurate and up-to-date
4. **Test any referenced procedures** to ensure they still work

### **After Archiving**
1. **Update any automation scripts** that referenced the old files
2. **Update any external documentation** that linked to the old files
3. **Test the new consolidated documentation** with your AI assistants
4. **Verify context pack integration** is working properly
