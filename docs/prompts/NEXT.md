**Yes, you're absolutely right!** Changing nameservers will affect your GoDaddy-hosted email, but you can definitely set up `chris@chrislawrence.ca` through other means.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Will Break:**
- **GoDaddy email** (if you're using it)
- **Any GoDaddy-specific DNS records**

## ‚úÖ **What You Can Do Instead:**

### **Option 1: Microsoft 365 (Recommended)**
- **Cost**: ~$6/month for Business Basic
- **Get**: `chris@chrislawrence.ca` + 50GB storage + Office apps
- **Setup**: Add MX records in Cloudflare after nameserver change

### **Option 2: Google Workspace**
- **Cost**: ~$6/month
- **Get**: `chris@chrislawrence.ca` + 30GB storage + Gmail interface

### **Option 3: Free Alternatives**
- **Zoho Mail**: Free for 1 user
- **ProtonMail**: Free tier available
- **Tutanota**: Free tier available

## üéØ **The Nameservers You Need:**

```
chris.ns.cloudflare.com
linda.ns.cloudflare.com
```

**Go ahead and change them!** Your homelab setup is more important than temporary email disruption.

## üìß **Quick Email Setup After Nameserver Change:**

1. **Choose your email provider** (I recommend Microsoft 365)
2. **Add MX records** in Cloudflare DNS
3. **Configure your email client**

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. **Click "Change Nameservers"** in GoDaddy
2. **Enter the Cloudflare nameservers**
3. **Wait 24-48 hours** for propagation
4. **Add DNS records** in Cloudflare
5. **Set up email** with your chosen provider

Your homelab will be working, and you'll have a professional email address! The temporary email disruption is worth it for the full functionality you'll gain.
